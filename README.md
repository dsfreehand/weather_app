# weather_app
Weather app that uses a full stack implementation.
As I said in my commit, I am very disappointed with the quality of the starter code and the code in the activities for the Module itself.
I feel like I would much better understand the concepts we went over if the activities actually worked during class.
I had to use a lot of help from Stack Exchange and AI tools to figure out what I have, and honestly...it still isn't fully functional.
I'm not getting 100%, and that's okay.
